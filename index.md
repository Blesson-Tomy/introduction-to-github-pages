<h3>The use of Github</h3>

Learning to use Github has been very educational for me. I spent my time learning how to create repositories, merge pull requests,
create Github pages and publish them as websites. While I understand that this is not much, I hope to continue to dedicate time 
and effort to continue learning about github so that by the time I graduate from University, I will be able to efficiently work 
on projects and use Github to its maximum potential. With that said, I would also like to thank the Gtech platform and Mulearn
for providing the lessons that enabled us to access all these amazing resources!
